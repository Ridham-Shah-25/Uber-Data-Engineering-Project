## Entire Process Explained:
* I got the dataset from https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page. The Dataset contains features like pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.
* I created a GCP Account.
